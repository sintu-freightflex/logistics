# Feasibility Study Report – FreightFlex

## 1. Purpose
This report assesses whether FreightFlex can be successfully developed, deployed, and operated given current technical, operational, financial, and legal constraints.

## 2. Technical Feasibility

### 2.1 Technology Stack Assessment
| Layer | Proposed Technology | Feasibility |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend (Web) | React.js + TypeScript | High – mature ecosystem, rich component libraries |
| Mobile App | React Native (iOS & Android) | High – shared JS codebase with web layer |
| Backend API | Python 3.11 + FastAPI | High – async-native, auto OpenAPI docs, Pydantic validation |
| ORM / Migrations | SQLAlchemy 2.0 + Alembic | High – industry standard for Python / MySQL |
| Database (Primary) | MySQL 8.0 | High – widely supported, ACID compliant, JSON column support |
| Cache / Sessions | Redis 7 | High – fast key-value store; supports Pub/Sub for WebSocket scaling |
| Real-time Tracking | FastAPI WebSocket + Redis Pub/Sub | High – built-in async WebSocket support in FastAPI |
| Maps & Routing | Google Maps Platform (Directions API) | High – industry standard |
| Payment Gateway | Razorpay / Stripe (with escrow support) | High – available in target markets |
| File Storage | Microsoft Azure / Google Cloud Storage | High – scalable, cost-effective |
| Hosting | Microsoft Azure / GCP (containerised via Docker + K8s) | High |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | High |

### 2.2 Key Technical Risks
| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| GPS accuracy on low-end Android devices | Fallback to network location; tolerance threshold |
| Escrow hold logic (regulatory) | Use licensed payment aggregator with escrow feature |
| Real-time load on WebSocket server | Horizontal scaling + load balancer |

**Verdict: Technically Feasible**

## 3. Operational Feasibility

### 3.1 Team Requirements
| Role | Count | Availability |
|---|---|---|
| Full-Stack Developers | 3–4 | To be hired / contracted |
| Mobile Developer | 1–2 | To be hired / contracted |
| UI/UX Designer | 1 | Available |
| QA Engineer | 1–2 | Available |
| DevOps Engineer | 1 | Part-time / outsourced |
| Product Owner | 1 | Available |

### 3.2 Process Changes
- Onboarding workflow for hauliers and suppliers replaces existing manual phone-based procurement.
- Admin team requires training on the verification and dispute resolution panel.

**Verdict: Operationally Feasible with standard hiring plan**

## 4. Financial Feasibility

### 4.1 Estimated Development Cost
| Phase | Estimated Effort | Cost Range |
|---|---|---|
| Documentation & Design | 4 weeks | Low |
| Core Development (5 sprints) | 16 weeks | Medium–High |
| Testing & UAT | 3 weeks | Low |
| Infrastructure Setup | Ongoing | Low–Medium |

### 4.2 Revenue Timeline
- Revenue commences on first completed job (post go-live, Week 20).
- Break-even projected at ~18–24 months post-launch based on assumed commission rate and GMV ramp.

**Verdict: Financially Feasible given adequate seed funding**

## 5. Legal & Regulatory Feasibility

### 5.1 Applicable Regulations
| Area | Regulation | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Data Privacy | GDPR (EU) / DPDPA (India) | Design must comply |
| Payment Escrow | RBI guidelines (India) / FCA (UK) | Use licensed aggregator |
| Driver Licensing | National Motor Vehicles Act | Verified via document upload |
| E-Signature | IT Act 2000 / eIDAS (EU) | Supported by platform |

### 5.2 Compliance Actions Required
1. Appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO).
2. Draft and publish Privacy Policy and Terms of Service before go-live.
3. Use a payment aggregator with a valid escrow/nodal account licence.

**Verdict: Legally Feasible with planned compliance actions**

## 6. Schedule Feasibility
A 20-week delivery timeline is achievable with a team of 6–8 engineers using Agile sprints, provided:
- All third-party API credentials are obtained by Week 2.
- Design mockups are finalised by Week 3.
- No major scope changes after Sprint 2.

**Verdict: Schedule Feasible**

## 7. Overall Feasibility Verdict
| Dimension | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Technical | Feasible |
| Operational | Feasible |
| Financial | Feasible |
| Legal | Feasible (with actions) |
| Schedule | Feasible |

**Recommendation: Proceed to full project planning and development.**
