## 4. Privacy by Design Measures

### 4.1 Data Minimisation
- Only collect data strictly necessary for platform operation.
- GPS tracking active **only** during IN_TRANSIT status — not when driver is offline.
- Location history retained for 90 days only, then purged.

### 4.2 Purpose Limitation
- Driver documents stored only for verification purposes and not shared with any third party.
- GPS data used only for live tracking and ETA — not for profiling or marketing.

### 4.3 Storage Limitation
- Job records: 7 years (financial regulatory requirement).
- GPS location history: 90 days.
- Verification documents: duration of active account + 1 year post-closure.
- User accounts: until deletion request, then 30-day grace period before hard delete.

### 4.4 Data Subject Rights
| Right | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Right of Access (SAR) | User can download their data via account settings |
| Right to Rectification | User can edit profile information at any time |
| Right to Erasure | Account deletion request; personal data purged within 30 days |
| Right to Portability | Export of job history and earnings in JSON/CSV |
| Right to Object (profiling) | No automated profiling in Phase 1; N/A |
| Right to Restrict Processing | Account suspension preserves data without active processing |

### 4.5 Consent Management
- Explicit consent collected at registration for:
  1. GPS tracking during active trips (separate toggle)
  2. Marketing communications (optional, off by default)
- Consent records stored with timestamp and version of Privacy Policy accepted.
- Users can withdraw GPS consent, which blocks them from accepting new jobs (disclosed in UX).

## 5. Security Controls

### 5.1 Authentication & Access
| Control | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Password hashing | bcrypt with cost factor ≥ 12 |
| JWT signing | RS256 (asymmetric); private key in Secrets Manager |
| Access token expiry | 24 hours |
| Refresh token expiry | 30 days; stored as hash in Redis |
| Failed login lockout | 10 attempts in 15 min → 15-min cooldown |
| MFA (Phase 2) | TOTP / SMS OTP for Admin accounts |
| Role-based access control | Enforced at API middleware; all endpoints require explicit role list |

### 5.2 Data in Transit
| Control | Implementation |
|---|---|
| TLS | TLS 1.2 minimum; TLS 1.3 preferred |
| HSTS | Strict-Transport-Security header (max-age 1 year, includeSubDomains) |
| Certificate | Wildcard cert via Microsoft Azure Certificate Manager / Let's Encrypt |
| WebSocket | WSS (TLS-encrypted WebSocket) |

### 5.3 Data at Rest
| Control | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Database encryption |Microsoft Azure rest (AES-256) |
| S3 / GCS encryption | Server-side encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS) |
| Secrets management | Microsoft Azure Secrets Manager; no secrets in code or env files in repos |
| Backup encryption | RDS automated backups inherit encryption |

### 5.4 Application Security (OWASP Top 10 Mapping)
| OWASP Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| A01 – Broken Access Control | RBAC on every endpoint; ownership checks (haulier can only access own jobs) |
| A02 – Cryptographic Failures | TLS everywhere; bcrypt; AES-256 at rest; no sensitive data in logs |
| A03 – Injection | Parameterised queries (ORM); input validation via class-validator; no raw SQL |
| A04 – Insecure Design | Threat modelling review pre-sprint; secure design principles in LLD |
| A05 – Security Misconfiguration | Hardened Docker images; minimal permissions; no default credentials |
| A06 – Vulnerable Components | Snyk in CI pipeline; weekly dependency audit; npm audit on PR |
| A07 – Auth Failures | Rate limiting on auth endpoints; token rotation; session invalidation on logout |
| A08 – Software Integrity | GitHub branch protection; signed commits; code review required |
| A09 – Logging Failures | Structured JSON logs; sensitive fields masked; Sentry for errors |
| A10 – SSRF | URL validation for any user-provided URLs; no internal metadata fetch |

### 5.5 File Upload Security
- Allowed types: PDF, JPG, PNG only (MIME type + magic bytes check).
- Maximum file size: 10 MB.
- Files scanned for malware (ClamAV or cloud-native scanning) before storage.
- Files served via pre-signed S3 URLs (time-limited, no public access).
- Files stored in separate S3 bucket with no public-read ACL.

### 5.6 Payment Security
- No card data stored on FreightFlex servers (PCI DSS scope minimisation).
- All card processing handled by PCI DSS compliant gateway (Razorpay/Stripe).
- Webhook signature verified (HMAC-SHA256) before processing any payment event.
- Idempotency key used on all payment API calls to prevent double-processing.

### 5.7 Infrastructure Security
| Control | Detail |
|---|---|
| VPC | All services in private subnets; only ALB in public subnet |
| Security groups | Minimal open ports; no 0.0.0.0/0 on DB or internal services |
| IAM | Least-privilege IAM roles; no root account used |
| Container scanning | ECR image scanning on push |
| DDoS protection | Microsoft Azure Shield Standard (Phase 1); WAF rules for rate limiting |

## 6. Incident Response Plan

### 6.1 Severity Levels
| Severity | Description | Response Time |
|---|---|---|
| P1 – Critical | Confirmed data breach, platform-wide data loss | 1 hour (24/7) |
| P2 – High | Suspected breach, payment system compromise | 4 hours |
| P3 – Medium | Single-user data exposure, minor vulnerability | 24 hours |
| P4 – Low | Security misconfiguration, no data exposed | 72 hours |

### 6.2 Breach Notification Timeline
- GDPR: Notify supervisory authority within **72 hours** of becoming aware.
- DPDPA: Notify Data Protection Board **as soon as possible** (within 72 hours guidance).
- Affected users notified without undue delay if high risk to their rights.

### 6.3 Incident Response Steps
1. **Detect** – Monitor alerts (Sentry, Datadog, CloudTrail).
2. **Contain** – Isolate affected service; revoke compromised credentials.
3. **Assess** – Determine scope of breach; what data, how many users.
4. **Notify** – Legal team notified immediately; regulatory notification if required.
5. **Remediate** – Patch vulnerability; re-deploy clean image.
6. **Review** – Post-incident report within 5 business days.
